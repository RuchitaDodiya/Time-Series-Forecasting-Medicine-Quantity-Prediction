# Time Series Forecasting Methods Analysis

This repository contains different methods for time series forecasting. For the purpose of analysis, we focus on tablets that occur more than 25 times. Each forecasting model is applied to a specific medicine, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated for each model.

### Data Source
The data for analysis is sourced from the `Data_PreProcessing` folder, which contains preprocessed data files.
